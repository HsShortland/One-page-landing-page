            <h1>My Top Five Doctor Who Episodes!</h1>
            <p>Always having been a fan of science fiction, Doctor Who is definitely one of my favourites. I have seen episodes from the past as a child, but I really do love the revamp. I may not have a favourite Doctor but I do have favourite episodes. It has always been about the story and the development of the Doctor that has made it for me. As well as the celebration of the amazing things human beings are capable of whilst reminding us of the ugly side of humanity too. The overarching theme of human connection is what makes Doctor Who so amazing.</p>

            <h2>DoomsDay - Season 02 Episode 13</h2>
            <p>This episode really resonates with me as a person that has known loss. Losing someone you love and the grief that comes with it is something that everyone experiences within their lifetime. I really love the way this episode evokes empathy for the feeling of loss and to honour those no longer here by continuing to live life. Lost but not forgotten, throughout future seasons it can be seen Rose had a special place in the Doctor's heart. </p>

            <h2>The sound of Drums, and Last of the Time Lords - Season 03 Episode 12 and 13</h2>
            <p>A bit of a cheat here as I have paired two episodes together. I feel that you can't have one without the other in this case. Harold Saxon taking control of the world with ambition to destroy other galaxies with the inability to return to Gallifrey. These two episodes are in my favourites list because in my opinion John Simm made the most fabulous The Master. Not forgetting some great tunes including Voodoo Child by Rogue Traders (try getting the rhythm out of your head) and I Can't Decide by the Scissor Sisters. To top it off these episodes make my favourites list because of the compelling story line, in which The Doctor is brought back to his self through the human race united as one because of a story. A shout out to the whole series for story development, it is brilliant.</p>

            <h2>Planet of the Ood - Season 04 Episode 03</h2>
            <p>This episode makes my favourites list because of the story once again. Freeing the Ood from slavery and a lifetime of service. I love the compassion and empathy of Donna from the start. Something I believe we should all have as human beings for one another. Another reason this makes my favourites list is the song of the Ood. It is beautiful to listen to and is again what unites the Ood as a form of story telling. Again it is reminiscent of people being united through music and the heritage and culture of people through their stories.</p>

            <h2>Turn Left - Season 04 Episode 11</h2>
            <p>To me this episode brings to mind the dreaded what if. What if I had just left 5 minutes earlier? What if I had said yes instead of no? The what could have been. Add in the dystopian aspect in reference to World War 2 and 'Labour Camps', and the return of Rose, this episode was a success for me. </p>

            <h2>The End of Time - Part 1 and Part 2</h2>
            <p>These two specials fall between season 4 and 5. They make my favourites list because of the obvious return of John Simm as The Master. Also Part 2 marks the demise of this version of The Doctor. With the Doctor's death  foretold in Season 4, it was only fitting that it came about in the form of self sacrifice to save Wilf. Another brilliant story, linked back to the previous episodes featuring The Master, with four knocks.</p>
